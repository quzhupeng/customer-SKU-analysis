# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the layout optimization of Pareto analysis charts to eliminate excessive whitespace on the right side and improve space utilization. The goal is to achieve the same effective layout as the quadrant scatter plot, which currently demonstrates optimal page width utilization without significant whitespace waste.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business analyst using the Pareto analysis feature, I want the chart to utilize the full available page width effectively, so that I can view larger, more detailed visualizations without wasted screen space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Pareto analysis is displayed THEN the chart SHALL occupy the full available container width without excessive right-side whitespace
2. WHEN comparing Pareto chart layout to quadrant scatter plot layout THEN both SHALL demonstrate similar space utilization efficiency
3. IF the current layout shows more than 20% unused horizontal space THEN the system SHALL optimize the layout to reduce whitespace to less than 10%

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user comparing different analysis types, I want consistent layout quality across all chart types, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing both Pareto and quadrant analysis charts THEN both SHALL have consistent container width utilization
2. WHEN the page is resized THEN the Pareto chart SHALL maintain optimal width utilization across different screen sizes
3. IF layout inconsistencies exist between chart types THEN the system SHALL apply uniform layout standards

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want to identify and fix the specific CSS/layout issues causing the whitespace problem, so that future chart implementations follow the same optimized pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the CSS differences THEN the system SHALL identify specific properties causing layout discrepancies
2. WHEN comparing container configurations THEN differences in width settings, grid layouts, and margin configurations SHALL be documented
3. IF grid configuration issues are found THEN the ECharts grid settings SHALL be optimized to match successful implementations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the Pareto chart to be responsive and well-laid out on various screen sizes, so that the analysis remains usable across desktop and mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the Pareto chart on desktop THEN it SHALL utilize at least 90% of available container width
2. WHEN accessing the Pareto chart on mobile devices THEN it SHALL maintain proportional layout without horizontal scrolling
3. WHEN the browser window is resized THEN the chart SHALL dynamically adjust to maintain optimal space utilization
