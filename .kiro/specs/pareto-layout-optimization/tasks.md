# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create layout analysis and measurement utilities
  - Implement JavaScript functions to measure actual container dimensions and space utilization
  - Create comparison utilities to analyze differences between Pareto and quadrant chart layouts
  - Add debugging tools to visualize container boundaries and margins
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 2. Optimize ECharts grid configuration for Pareto charts
  - Modify the displayParetoChart function in static/js/app.js to use more aggressive grid margins
  - Change grid configuration from current 8% left/right margins to 3% for better space utilization
  - Adjust top/bottom margins from 15% to 12% to match quadrant chart standards
  - Ensure containLabel: true is maintained for proper axis label display
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.1_

- [ ] 3. Refine CSS container styling for consistent layout
  - Update .chart-container.full-width padding in static/css/style.css to minimize unused space
  - Optimize .additional-charts margin settings to eliminate layout calculation issues
  - Ensure .enhanced-chart width is explicitly set to 100% for full container utilization
  - Add CSS custom properties for consistent margin values across chart types
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 4. Implement responsive layout optimizations
  - Update media queries in static/css/style.css to use consistent space utilization across screen sizes
  - Ensure mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts all achieve similar space efficiency ratios
  - Optimize breakpoint values to align with actual device usage patterns
  - Test and adjust container dimensions for different viewport sizes
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 5. Create layout comparison and validation tools
  - Implement JavaScript functions to measure and compare space utilization between chart types
  - Create automated tests to verify consistent layout behavior across different screen sizes
  - Add visual debugging tools to highlight container boundaries and unused space
  - Implement performance monitoring to ensure optimizations don't impact chart rendering speed
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Integrate and test cross-browser compatibility
  - Test layout optimizations across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers
  - Implement CSS fallbacks for older browser versions that may not support modern grid features
  - Validate that chart resizing works correctly when browser windows are resized
  - Ensure consistent appearance and behavior across all supported browsers
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
