- **`/column_configuration`** (GET, POST, PUT): Manage column configurations
- **`/field_mapping_validation`** (POST): Validate field mapping configurations  
- **`/column_preview`** (POST): Get preview data for specific columns
- Enhanced **`/analyze`** endpoint to support custom field mappings

#### 2. Enhanced Field Detection and Mapping (analyzer.py)
- Updated `DataAnalyzer` class to accept custom field mappings
- Modified `detect_fields()` method to apply user-defined mappings with highest priority
- Flexible field validation that works with missing optional fields

#### 3. Comprehensive Validation System (utils.py)
- **`validate_field_mappings()`**: Comprehensive field mapping validation
- **`validate_column_data_quality()`**: Data quality assessment for mapped columns

- **`get_field_definitions()`**: Complete field definition metadata

#### 4. Dynamic UI Components (templates/index.html)
- Column configuration modal with intuitive interface
- Available columns panel with search functionality
- Field mapping area with drag-and-drop support
- Real-time validation status display
- Analysis type selector with dynamic field requirements

#### 5. Interactive JavaScript Functionality (static/js/app.js)
- **Column Selection**: Interactive column list with preview
- **Drag & Drop Mapping**: Intuitive field mapping interface
- **Real-time Validation**: Live validation feedback
- **Session Storage**: Persistent configuration during session
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatic view updates when configuration changes

#### 6. Responsive CSS Styling (static/css/style.css)
- Modern modal design with responsive layout
- Color-coded field requirements (required/recommended/optional)
- Interactive drag-and-drop visual feedback
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Pre-Analysis Column Mapping
- ✅ Display all available columns from uploaded Excel file
- ✅ Allow users to map Excel columns to required analysis fields
- ✅ Real-time validation of required vs optional fields
- ✅ Preview sample data for each column

### 2. Flexible Field Validation
- ✅ Different requirements for each analysis type (product/customer/region)
- ✅ Required fields clearly marked and enforced
- ✅ Optional fields that enhance analysis but aren't required
- ✅ Graceful degradation when optional fields are missing

### 3. Session-based Persistence
- ✅ Save column configurations in browser session storage
- ✅ Persist preferences during current session
- ✅ Support multiple file configurations simultaneously
- ✅ Automatic configuration loading when reopening files

### 4. Dynamic Analysis Views
- ✅ Tables automatically reflect selected columns
- ✅ Charts adapt to available data fields
- ✅ Automatic refresh when configuration changes
- ✅ Intelligent field prioritization based on user mappings

### 5. User Experience Enhancements
- ✅ Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- ✅ Clear visual feedback on validation status
- ✅ Contextual help and suggestions
- ✅ Smart auto-detection with manual override capability

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **File Upload** → Sheet Selection → **Column Configuration** → Analysis
2. **Auto-detection** → User Review/Override → **Validation** → Save Configuration
3. **Session Storage** → Configuration Persistence → **Auto-load** on Reopen

### Field Mapping Structure
```javascript
{
  fileId: "uuid",
  sheetName: "分客户", 
  fieldMappings: {
    customer: "客户名称",
    product: "产品名称",
    quantity: "销售数量", 
    amount: "销售金额",
    profit: "毛利"
  },
  analysisType: "customer",
  validationStatus: {
    isValid: true,
    requiredFieldsMapped: true,
    suggestions: []
  }
}
```

### Validation Levels
- **Required Fields**: Must be mapped for analysis to proceed
- **Recommended Fields**: Enhance analysis quality, warnings if missing
- **Optional Fields**: Provide additional insights, no warnings if missing

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup
1. User uploads Excel file and selects sheet
2. System auto-detects field mappings
3. User clicks "Configure Columns" to review/modify
4. Column configuration modal opens with detected mappings
5. User adjusts mappings using drag-and-drop or selection
6. Real-time validation provides feedback
7. User saves configuration and proceeds to analysis

### 2. Mid-Analysis Reconfiguration  
1. User clicks "Column Settings" in analysis view
2. Configuration modal opens with current settings
3. User modifies column selections or field mappings
4. System validates changes and shows impact
5. User applies changes
6. Analysis views automatically refresh

### 3. Session Persistence
1. Configurations automatically saved to session storage
2. When user reopens same file, configuration is restored
3. Multiple file configurations maintained simultaneously
4. Session cleared when browser closed or manually reset

## Error Handling & Validation

### Field Validation Rules
- **Product Analysis**: Requires product field + ≥1 numeric field
- **Customer Analysis**: Requires customer field + ≥1 numeric field  
- **Region Analysis**: Requires region field + ≥1 numeric field

### Data Quality Checks
- Empty column detection (>50% null values = error)
- Data type consistency validation
- Reasonable unique value counts for categorical fields
- Negative value warnings for quantity/amount fields

### User Feedback
- Clear error messages with specific suggestions
- Warning indicators for data quality issues
- Progress indicators during validation
- Contextual help tooltips

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. User Control
- Full control over which columns to include in analysis
- Ability to override automatic field detection
- Flexible mapping of columns to analysis fields
- Support for various Excel file structures

### 2. Data Quality
- Preview data before analysis to catch issues early
- Validate field mappings before processing  
- Handle missing or incomplete data gracefully
- Intelligent suggestions for optimal field selection

### 3. Flexibility
- Support various Excel file structures and naming conventions
- Adapt to different business contexts and data formats
- Work with partial data sets when some fields unavailable
- Extensible framework for adding new field types

### 4. User Experience
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface reduces learning curve
- Clear visual feedback on validation status
- Contextual help and suggestions guide users
- Responsive design works on desktop and mobile

## Testing & Validation

### Automated Tests
- Field validation logic testing
- Data quality assessment testing  
- Session storage functionality testing
- API endpoint response validation

### Manual Testing Scenarios
- Various Excel file structures and formats
- Different analysis types with missing fields
- Edge cases with empty or invalid data
- User workflow testing across different browsers

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Advanced Field Mapping**: Support for calculated fields and transformations
2. **Template System**: Save and reuse column configurations across files
3. **Batch Processing**: Apply same configuration to multiple similar files
4. **Data Validation Rules**: Custom validation rules for specific business contexts
5. **Export/Import**: Share column configurations between users

### Scalability Considerations
- Database persistence for enterprise deployments
- User account integration for personal configurations
- Advanced caching for large file processing
- API rate limiting and performance optimization

## Conclusion
